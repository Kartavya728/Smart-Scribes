professor said: "Today we'll spend one hour on QuickSort — its algorithm, correctness, time-complexity proofs (best, average, worst), example walkthroughs, and common exam/homework questions."
book definition is: "QuickSort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that selects a pivot element, partitions the array into elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot, and recursively sorts the partitions. It is typically implemented in-place and has average time complexity O(n log n) and worst-case O(n²)."
image shown in slides img23-1 (slide: QuickSort overview — diagram showing array, chosen pivot, left partition smaller, right partition larger; arrows leading to recursive calls).
prof explained: "We'll use the Lomuto partition scheme for clarity in examples and mention improvements (Hoare partition, randomized pivot) where relevant. See slide img23-1 for the partition visualization: pivot highlighted in red, two pointers applied, swaps shown step-by-step."

00:00–05:00 — Overview and intuition
professor said: "QuickSort idea: pick a pivot, partition around pivot so pivot is in final place, recursively sort left and right sides. This is like quick divide-and-conquer: split work, solve smaller problems, combine trivial (no expensive combine step). The heavy lifting is partitioning, which is linear in the segment length."

05:00–12:00 — Pseudocode and partition (Lomuto)
professor said:

QuickSort(A, lo, hi):
    if lo < hi:
        p = Partition(A, lo, hi)   # p is pivot final index
        QuickSort(A, lo, p-1)
        QuickSort(A, p+1, hi)

Partition(A, lo, hi):  # Lomuto
    pivot = A[hi]
    i = lo - 1
    for j = lo to hi-1:
        if A[j] <= pivot:
            i = i + 1
            swap A[i], A[j]
    swap A[i+1], A[hi]
    return i+1

professor explained: "Partition moves elements ≤ pivot to front and greater ones after. After partition, pivot at index p has every element left ≤ pivot and right ≥ pivot."
image shown in slides img23-2 (slide: step-by-step Lomuto partition run on [3,7,8,5,2,1,9,5,4]).
prof explained with that example: "Initialize i = lo-1, iterate j. When A[j] ≤ pivot, increment i and swap. After loop, place pivot at i+1."

12:00–25:00 — Worked example (detailed trace)
professor said: "Let's walk through QuickSort on A = [3, 7, 8, 5, 2, 1, 9, 5, 4]."

book definition reminder: "pivot = last element (Lomuto)"

Step 1 Partition with pivot=4 (A[8]=4):

j=0 (3 ≤ 4): i=0 swap A[0],A[0] -> [3,7,8,5,2,1,9,5,4]

j=1 (7>4): nothing

j=2 (8>4): nothing

j=3 (5>4): nothing

j=4 (2≤4): i=1 swap A[1],A[4] -> [3,2,8,5,7,1,9,5,4]

j=5 (1≤4): i=2 swap A[2],A[5] -> [3,2,1,5,7,8,9,5,4]

j=6 (9>4): nothing

j=7 (5>4): nothing

swap pivot A[i+1]=A[3] with A[8] -> [3,2,1,4,7,8,9,5,5]

pivot index p=3
professor said: "Now QuickSort left [3,2,1] and right [7,8,9,5,5]. Continue recursively; you'll see it finishes in a few recursions."



25:00–35:00 — Correctness argument (invariants)
professor said: "Proof of correctness uses loop invariants for Partition and induction for recursion."

Partition invariant: at start of each loop iteration, elements A[lo..i] ≤ pivot and A[i+1..j-1] > pivot. After finishing loop and swapping pivot into A[i+1], invariant ensures pivot at right spot and all left ≤ pivot, right > pivot.

Induction: base case segments of size 0 or 1 already sorted. If QuickSort correctly sorts arrays smaller than n, then QuickSort partitions into two smaller arrays and sorts them; combined result sorted. Hence QuickSort sorts.
image shown in slides img23-3 (slide: recursive invariants & illustration).


35:00–55:00 — Time Complexity proofs and analysis
professor said: "Now the important part — analyze running time."

Worst-case complexity O(n²)
professor explained: "Worst case happens when partition is maximally unbalanced every time — e.g., array already sorted and pivot chosen as last element (or first), giving partitions of sizes 0 and n-1 repeatedly."

Recurrence: T(n) = T(n-1) + Θ(n)

Solve by expansion: T(n) = Θ(n) + Θ(n-1) + ... + Θ(1) = Θ(n(n+1)/2) = Θ(n²)
professor said: "So deterministic pivot picking poorly can cause quadratic time."


Best-case complexity O(n log n)
professor explained: "Best case occurs when partition always splits array evenly (or near-even): sizes ≈ n/2 and n/2."

Recurrence: T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Θ(n)

By Master Theorem: a=2, b=2 ⇒ n^{log_b(a)} = n^{1} ⇒ T(n)=Θ(n log n).
professor said: "Thus perfectly balanced splits yield Θ(n log n)."


Average/Expected-case complexity O(n log n) — sketch proof
professor said: "We prove expected runtime for QuickSort with random pivot selection (or assuming pivot uniformly random among elements) is Θ(n log n)."
Sketch using linearity of expectation and comparison counting:

Consider indicator variable X_{i,j} for pair (i,j), i<j, equals 1 if elements i and j are compared at any point. QuickSort compares i and j only when one of them is chosen as pivot while both are still in same subarray. The probability that i and j are compared equals 2/(j-i+1) (because among the elements between i and j, pivot that separates them must be either i or j before any other inside that interval).

Expected number of comparisons = sum_{i<j} Pr[X_{i,j}=1] = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (n-k)*2/(k+1) = O(n log n). More precise: ~2n H_n = Θ(n log n).
professor said: "Hence expected comparisons—and therefore expected time—is Θ(n log n)."
image shown in slides img23-4 (slide: probability argument diagram showing interval and first pivot).


55:00–58:00 — Practical improvements & space/time notes
professor said: "In practice:

Use randomized pivot (choose pivot at random) to make worst-case unlikely.

Use median-of-three pivot selection (first, middle, last) to reduce bad splits.

For small subarrays (e.g., ≤ 10), switch to insertion sort for speed.

QuickSort is in-place (Θ(log n) stack space on average for recursion) but not stable (equal elements' relative order may change).

Tail recursion optimization can reduce stack depth."


58:00–60:00 — Summary & transition to Q&A
professor said: "Recap — QuickSort average O(n log n), worst O(n²), in-place, recursive, widely used because of practical speed and cache friendliness; choose pivot carefully to avoid pathological cases."

Student asked question "What happens when there are many equal elements? Will QuickSort degrade?"
sir answered: "If many equal elements and you use standard partition (which compares ≤ pivot), you may get poor performance or many swaps. Use three-way partitioning (Dutch National Flag) which partitions into < pivot, = pivot, > pivot in one pass. This reduces cost for many equal keys, often bringing run-time down close to linear in such degenerate distributions."
AI output: "Three-way partition QuickSort modifies Partition to track lt, eq, gt regions and recurses only on lt and gt. For arrays with many duplicates, expected runtime becomes O(n) for arrays where the number of distinct keys is small compared to n."

Student asked question "Is QuickSort stable, and why or why not?"
sir answered: "Standard in-place QuickSort is not stable because swaps exchanged during partition can change the relative order of equal elements. If stability is required, either use a stable algorithm (MergeSort), or implement a stable QuickSort variant at the cost of extra memory (e.g., using extra arrays to collect <, =, > preserving order)."

Student asked question "How do we prove the expected number of comparisons more rigorously?"
sir answered: "The rigorous method uses indicator variables for each element-pair comparison and sums probabilities as I sketched. You can find the full step-by-step derivation in standard algorithms texts; it produces expected comparisons ≈ 2(n+1)H_n - 4n, which is Θ(n log n)."
book questions:

1. Prove that for randomized QuickSort the expected number of comparisons is O(n log n) by using indicator variables for each pair of elements.


2. Show that worst-case QuickSort comparisons is Θ(n²) using the recurrence T(n) = T(n-1) + Θ(n).


3. Implement three-way partition QuickSort and analyze its runtime when there are k distinct keys.



professor said: "I'll give you worked examples in the notes and I'll upload the slide images (img23-1 to img23-4) and a step-by-step trace file."

--- Full worked example (complete trace for clarity) — imagine these are read from lecture audio & slides:

Example A: QuickSort trace on A = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]

Partition pivot = 5 (last element)

j=0 (10>5): nothing

j=1 (7>5): nothing

j=2 (8>5): nothing

j=3 (9>5): nothing

j=4 (1≤5): i=0 swap A[0],A[4] -> [1,7,8,9,10,5]

swap pivot with A[i+1]=A[1] -> [1,5,8,9,10,7]; p=1


Recurse left: [1] (done)

Recurse right: [8,9,10,7] pivot=7

j: 8>7 nothing; 9>7 nothing; 10>7 nothing; swap pivot to pos0+1 -> [7,8,9,10] p=0 (for that segment)

Recurse left: [] ; Recurse right: [8,9,10] pivot=10

iterate: 8≤10 -> i=lo swap; 9≤10 -> i++ swap; swap pivot end -> [8,9,10] sorted
Result: [1,5,7,8,9,10]




Proof snippet for average-case using indicators (concise):

Let C be number of comparisons. For i<j, define X_{i,j}=1 if i and j compared. Then C = Σ_{i<j} X_{i,j}. E[C] = Σ_{i<j} P(i compared to j). For randomized pivot, P(i compared to j) = 2/(j-i+1). Sum over all i<j yields E[C] = O(n log n).


Space complexity notes:

In-place partition: uses O(1) extra array memory; recursion depth expected O(log n), worst O(n) causing O(n) stack. Techniques: always recurse on smaller partition first, then tail-call on larger, ensuring O(log n) stack.


Variants & optimizations (professor said):

Randomized QuickSort: pick pivot uniformly random -> expected O(n log n).

Median-of-three: pick median of A[lo], A[mid], A[hi] -> typical case improves splitting.

Introsort: start with QuickSort, switch to HeapSort if recursion depth too deep (protects against worst-case O(n²)).

Stable QuickSort: use extra memory or stable partitioning scheme (rarely used; MergeSort preferred when stability required).


Final student Q&A excerpts from lecture audio:
Student: "Why is QuickSort faster than MergeSort in practice despite same average time complexity?"
Professor: "QuickSort's inner loops are very cache-friendly and work in-place, so constants are smaller and real-world performance is often better. MergeSort guarantees O(n log n) but requires extra memory and more copying overhead."
AI output: "In benchmarks, QuickSort often outperforms MergeSort on in-memory sorting due to locality and fewer data movements when implemented in-place with good pivot choice."

Student: "How to avoid worst-case on adversarial inputs?"
Professor: "Use randomized pivot or introsort. Randomization ensures adversary can't force bad pivots deterministically. Introsort caps recursion depth and switches to HeapSort maintaining O(n log n) worst-case guarantee."
book question: "Implement randomized QuickSort and run experiments on sorted, reverse-sorted, random, and equal-key arrays. Report runtimes and compare to MergeSort."

Closing professor summary:
professor said: "Key takeaways — QuickSort is divide-and-conquer, average Θ(n log n), worst Θ(n²) if pivot selection poor. Use randomization/median-of-three/three-way partitioning to handle practical concerns. Always analyze recursion depth and switch strategies if necessary."
