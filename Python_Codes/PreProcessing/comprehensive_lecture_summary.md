## Lecture Segment‚ÄØ1 ‚Äì Rotational Dynamics (0:00‚Äì5:00)

### 1. Core Topics Discussed
- **Moment of inertia for a composite rod**  
  - The lecturer combined two contributions: \( \frac{mL^{2}}{12} \) (rod about its centre) and \( \frac{mL^{2}}{16} \) (rod about an end).  
  - The **least common multiple (LCM)** of the denominators \(12\) and \(16\) is \(48\); the combined inertia becomes \(\displaystyle I=\frac{7\,mL^{2}}{48}\).

- **Angular momentum about a given axis**  
  - Formula used: \(\displaystyle \mathbf{L}=I\boldsymbol{\omega}\).  
  - In the problem the angular speed is given as \(\omega_{0}\); therefore \(\mathbf{L}= \frac{7\,mL^{2}}{48}\,\omega_{0}\).

- **Parallel‚Äëaxis theorem reminder**  
  - The instructor emphasized that the theorem can be applied **only when one of the axes passes through the centre of mass (CM)**.  
  - A common student error (using \( \frac{mL^{2}}{12}+m\frac{L}{4}^{2}\) without a CM axis) was clarified.

- **Rotational kinetic energy and its link to angular momentum**  
  - Rotational kinetic energy: \(\displaystyle K_{\text{rot}}=\frac{1}{2}I\omega^{2}\).  
  - Substituting \(\omega = L/I\) yields the useful relation  
    \[
    K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{L^{2}}{2I}.
    \]  
  - Rearranged, \(L = \sqrt{2IK}\).  
  - The lecturer highlighted the **analogy with linear motion**, where \(K_{\text{lin}} = p^{2}/(2m)\) (\(p = mv\)).

### 2. Key Concepts Reinforced
- **Composite moments of inertia** ‚Äì add contributions after expressing them with a common denominator.  
- **Validity of the parallel‚Äëaxis theorem** ‚Äì one axis must go through the CM.  
- **Inter‚Äërelationship of rotational quantities** ‚Äì \(L\), \(I\), \(\omega\), and \(K_{\text{rot}}\) are not independent; the derived formula \(K = L^{2}/(2I)\) is especially handy for problem‚Äësolving.

### 3. Textbook Connections
| Textbook Section | Relevant Content | Page |
|------------------|------------------|------|
| **Rotational Kinetic Energy** ‚Äì derivation of \(K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^{2}\) and the combined translational/rotational energy expression. | Provides the formal basis for the kinetic‚Äëenergy formula used in the lecture. | **LectureCh10, p.‚ÄØ35** (relevance‚ÄØ0.38) |
| **Units of Chapter‚ÄØ10** ‚Äì list of angular quantities, torque, and rotational inertia. | Supplies the terminology (e.g., \(I\), \(\omega\), \(\mathbf{L}\)) that the lecturer repeatedly invoked. | **LectureCh10, p.‚ÄØ2** (relevance‚ÄØ0.36) |
| **Chapter‚ÄØ10 Overview ‚Äì Rotational Motion** | Sets the broader context for the lecture‚Äôs focus on angular momentum and kinetic energy. | **LectureCh10, p.‚ÄØ1** (relevance‚ÄØ0.36) |

### 4. Link to Earlier Material (if any)
- The discussion builds on the introductory definitions of angular quantities (Chapter‚ÄØ10, p.‚ÄØ1‚Äë2) and prepares the student for later problem‚Äësolving sections where the \(L\)‚Äì\(K\) relationship will be exploited.

### 5. Take‚Äëaway Message
Remember:
1. **Combine moments of inertia carefully** (common denominator).  
2. **Parallel‚Äëaxis theorem ‚Üí axis through CM**.

SO, THIS IS A FORMULA. SO, THIS IS A FORMULA. SO, FROM HERE, SO M L SQUARE BY 12 PLUS M L SQUARE BY 16. SO, HERE WHAT WILL BE THE LCM? SO, 48 AND THEN WE GET. SO, THIS IS 4 TIMES 4 ML SQUARE PLUS THIS WILL BE 3 ML SQUARE RIGHT. SO, TOTAL 7 ML SQUARE BY 48. SO, THIS IS A SO, NOW WHAT IS ANGULAR MOMENTUM L ABOUT THE GIVEN AXIS IS EQUALS TO MOMENTUM OF INERTIA ABOUT THAT AXIS IS 7 ML SQUARE BY 48 INTO OMEGA, IN PLACE OF OMEGA RIGHT OMEGA NAUGHT BECAUSE IN THE QUESTION THEY GIVE IT AS OMEGA NAUGHT. UNDERSTAND, CLEAR EVERYONE, THEN THIS PART, CHAN, SO FINE. SO, WHAT IS THE OPTION? OPTION I SAID YES OPTION 3 IS A CORRECT ONE. SEE SOME STUDENTS MIGHT BE THINKING THAT SIR WHY WE HAVE TO APPLY THE PARALLEL AXIS THEOREM ONLY HERE LIKE ML SQUARE BY 12 PLUS M INTO L BY 4 WHOLE SQUARE. SO, WE CAN APPLY THE PARALLEL AXIS THEOREM HERE ALSO. I KNOW ABOUT THIS AXIS WHICH IS ML SQUARE BY 3. ABOUT ONE END PLUS FROM ND DZ DISTANCE OF L BY 4 AND THOSE TWO AXES ARE PARALLEL WE CAN APPLY THE PARALLEL AXIS THEOREM THEY ARE ALSO NO. BECAUSE PARALLEL AXIS THEOREM CAN ONLY BE APPLIED IF ONE OF THE AXIS IS PASSING THROUGH THE CENTER OF MASS. AXIS SHOULD PASS THROUGH THE CENTER OF MASS THEN ONLY YOU CAN APPLY THE PARALLEL AXIS THEOREM OTHERWISE LOW, CLEAR? SO THIS QUESTION IS FINE. NOW LET US GO FOR THE NEXT. SO, THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM AND KINETIC ENERGY. SO, THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM AND KINETIC ENERGY SEE THE SIMPLE THING IS WE KNOW THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM L IS EQUAL TO MBR, THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM L IS EQUAL TO MBR AND THEN SO WHAT IS THE KINETIC ENERGY? IS EQUAL TO SORRY THE KINETIC ENERGY BETTER LET US TAKE THIS FORMULA. SO, L IS EQUAL TO I OMEGA WE KNOW. THIS IS THE ANGULAR MOMENT OF IN TERMS OF MOMENT OF INERTIA AND OMEGA I WILL TAKE IT. AND THEN KINETIC ENERGY FORMULA ALSO YOU KNOW WHICH KINETIC ENERGY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE. THE ROTATIONAL KINETIC ENERGY, THE ROTATIONAL KINETIC ENERGY. SO, HALF INTO I OMEGA SQUARE, HALF INTO I OMEGA SQUARE. SO, NOW WHAT I AM DOING IS, SO, LET US WRITE IT HERE. SO, HERE LET ME TAKE. SO, THE KINETIC ENERGY, THE ROTATIONAL KINETIC ENERGY IS HALF I OMEGA SQUARE NOW, SO FROM THIS EQUATION, LET ME WRITE OMEGA IS EQUALS TO L BY I, OMEGA IS EQUALS TO L BY I, LET US SUBSTITUTE THIS HERE. SO, THEN THAT KINETIC ENERGY WILL BE EQUALS TO HALF INTO I INTO IN PLACE OF OMEGA LET US WRITE L BY I L BY I WHOLE SQUARE IN PLACE OF OMEGA, I AM WRITING L BY I WHOLE SQUARE. SO, THEN THE KINETIC ENERGY IS EQUALS TO HALF INTO I INTO. SO, HERE L SQUARE BY I SQUARE SIMPLE CALCULATIONS I I GETS CANCELLED. SO, THAT WE GET KINETIC ENERGY K LET US WRITE KINETIC ENERGY SO, K IS EQUAL TO HALF INTO L SQUARE BY I. SO, FROM HERE LET ME WRITE I IS EQUAL EQUALS TO OR ELSE L SQUARE IS EQUALS TO 2 I K L SQUARE IS EQUALS TO 2 I K FROM HERE THE L IS EQUAL EQUALS TO ROOT OVER 2 I K. SO, THE L IS EQUALS TO ROOT OVER 2 I K. SEE HERE. SO, WHAT WE ARE DOING? ACTUALLY WE ARE ESTABLISHING A RELATION BETWEEN THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM AND ROTATIONAL KINETIC ENERGY. SO, L IS A ANGULAR MOMENTUM HERE L IS A ANGULAR MOMENTUM AND THEN SO K IS A ROTATIONAL ENERGY HERE, IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE K IS A ROTATIONAL KINETIC ENERGY, UNDERSTOOD. SO, TO REMEMBER THIS FORMULA, YOU CAN SIMPLY FOLLOW THE ANALOG SO LET ME DO WRITE IT IN THE NEXT SLIDE. SO YOU CAN SIMPLY FOLLOW THE ANALOG YOU GUYS. SO WHAT'S THE ANALOG? LET ME CHECK IF WE HAVE THE STEM. SO, SEE HERE THE ANALOG KEY. SO, IN THE CASE OF LINEAR, LINEAR MOTION. SO, WE KNOW THAT THE RELATION BETWEEN LINEAR MOMENTUM AND KINETIC ENERGY, WE ALREADY ESTABLISHED THIS, THAT RELATION
