   - Complete algorithm summary
   - When to use/avoid QuickSort

#### Student Questions (5 Q&A pairs):
1. **32:30** — Many equal elements degradation? → Three-way partitioning
2. **38:45** — Is QuickSort stable? → No, and why
3. **52:15** — Rigorous proof of expected comparisons
4. **56:20** — Why faster than MergeSort in practice?
